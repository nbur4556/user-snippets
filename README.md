# user-snippets
Collection of my personal user snippets.

## Installation
Open VS Code, and access the command pallette.

```
ctrl + shift + p
```

Search for "snippets" and select "Preferences: Configure User Snippets".

Search for and select "javascript.json".

Copy the javascript.json file from this repo, and paste it over the json object in VS Code. __Pasting over will remove all existing user snippets.__ If you do not want to replace your existing snippets paste inside the existing JSON object beneath the current list of snippets.
